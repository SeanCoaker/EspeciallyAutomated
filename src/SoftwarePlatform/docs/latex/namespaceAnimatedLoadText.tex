\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}A module heavily based on code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22029562/python-how-to-
make-simple-animated-loading-while-process-is-running to provide animated text below the 
progress bar during the batch upload process.

This module is executed within its own thread to provide an animated loading icon to the label 
below the progress bar in the upload dialog window. This code has been adapted slightly from 
the code at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22029562/python-how-to-make-simple-animated-
loading-while-process-is-running to provide the desired solution.

    Typical usage example:

    self.loader = Loader(self.progressBarLabel, f'Starting {_espDevices[index]} - {ip[0]}...')
                    .start()
    self.loader.stop()\end{DoxyVerb}
